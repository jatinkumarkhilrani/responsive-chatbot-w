- ✅ Bundle size analysis and performance monitoring
- ✅ TypeScript strict checking with proper error handling

### 6. **Deployment Pipeline**
- ✅ Multi-target build system (GitHub Pages + Standalone)
- ✅ Automated CI/CD with proper error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ GitHub Pages routing fixes for SPA behavior
- ✅ Service worker ready for offline functionality

### 7. **Security & Privacy**
- ✅ **Local-First Architecture**: All data stored in browser, not external servers
- ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Configurable API keys and endpoints
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage preventing runtime errors
- ✅ **Content Security**: Proper error boundaries and input validation

## 📱 User Experience Fixes

### 8. **Responsive Design**
- ✅ **Fixed Sidebar Overlapping**: Proper mobile/desktop layout switching
- ✅ **Settings Dialog**: No more UI boundary issues or text overlapping
- ✅ **Full Screen Usage**: Chat area now uses complete available space
- ✅ **Touch Targets**: Proper button sizes and touch-friendly interactions

### 9. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- ✅ **Efficient Re-renders**: Proper React patterns preventing unnecessary updates
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Reduced from potentially 10MB+ to under 3MB

### 10. **AI Integration**
